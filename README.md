Some tradeoffs and decisions I made:
 - I opted to use radix-ui since I wanted a card component and had just heard about it. I ended up using a few of their UI components.
 - I only used the `organic_results` from serpapi. Since the assignment was meant to take an hour or two, this was one way to keep scope low. Would certainly make use of knowledge graph, images, and inline videos if I decided to spend more time.
 - This is the first Remix project I've used so hopefully I didn't butcher the loader and fetcher.
